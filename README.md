# System Programming

This course teaches how to be an intelligent user of sophisticated runtime environments. The
programs we design are built to operate in the context of a software environment. Understanding
the interaction between programs and their software environment (runtime environment) is the main
topic ofthis course. Issues covered in the course are:

- System programming language: Java, C++, Scrip.
- Runtime environment: JVM, UNIX
- Distributed runtime environment - Memory management, Network, etc..
- Concurrency: multi-threading, Livenss & Safety.
- Object Oriented Design & Design patterns.
- Introduction to C++ and STL - Pointers, Parameter passing, Virtual memory.
- Communication - Protocols, synchronous and asynchronous io.
- Databases - Relational database, introduction to SQL


## Assignment 1 - BGU fitness studio management system

Assignment Goals:
- The objective of this assignment is to design an object-oriented system and gain implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures, and unique C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”. You will learn how to handle memory in C++ and avoid memory leaks. The resulting program must be as efficient as possible.

## Assignment 2 - Compute Resources Management System
Assignment Goals:

- In the following assignment, you are required to implement a simple Micro-Service framework, which you will then use to 
implement a system for managing the University compute resources.

This assignment is composed of two main sections:
-  Building a simple Micro-Service framework.
- Implementing a system for managing the university computer resources on top of
this framework.


## Assignment 3 - BGU social network

Assignment Goals: 
- In this assignment you will implement a simple social network server and client. The communication between the server and the client(s) will be performed using a binary communication protocol.


## Assignment 4 - 

Assignment Goals: 
- In this assignment you are required to implement the database of Pizza Hat, a shop specialized in pizza shaped hats. The assignment is composed of three parts:
- Create and populate the database according to a configuration file. 2. Execute a list of orders, according to a second file.
- Print a summary in a third file.
